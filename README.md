# Leaf-blight-detection-using-Tensorflow

In this project, the CNN has been implemented using Tensorflow. The code is available in the .ipynb file here.
The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset
Also, the kaggle.json file will have to be created by creating a new kaggle API token.
The dataset will be directly called in from Kaggle and will be loaded in Google Colab.
