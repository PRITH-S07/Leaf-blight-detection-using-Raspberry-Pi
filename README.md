# Leaf-blight-detection-using-Raspberry-Pi

Raspberry pi based leaf disease detection using KNN and deep neural network.

In this project, the CNN has been implemented using Tensorflow. <br>
The code is available in the .ipynb file here.<br>
The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset<br>
Also, the kaggle.json file will have to be created by creating a new kaggle API token.<br>
The dataset will be directly called in from Kaggle and will be loaded in Google Colab. <br>
